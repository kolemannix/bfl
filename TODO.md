# Back to working
- [x] Implement typed IR
- [x] Implement FnCall
- [x] Implement Add
- [x] Implement Multiply
- [x] Use basicvalue not pointervalue as main IR type
- [x] Add booleans
- [x] Add boolean AND and OR
- [ ] Parse line comments and implement "expected output" for test sources
- [ ] Ditch semicolons
- [ ] Implement IF expressions

# Tier 1
- [ ] main function
- [x] Binary infix operations
- [ ] Structs
- [ ] Loops
- [ ] Type Params
- [ ] Heap memory
- [ ] Tuples
- [ ] fix scoping

Design for 
- optionality
- fallibility

Symbols like lisp or Clojure keywords would be really great; or just have string literal types?
Symbols are always interned and very fast. Also signals intent to use a symbol vs use strings

# Dev ex
- Pretty-print AST
- Error Spans
- fancy output COLORS

# Tier 2
- [ ] Block-as-single-arg syntax (xs.map { y => } )
- [ ] Unicode source
- [ ] multiple parameter lists

# Milestones
1. [ ]
