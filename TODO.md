# Up next maybe

# Project Completion Checklist

- [ ] QoL before rest of pattern matching
  - [ ] Move spans into SoA on AST
  - [x] Codegen fail instead of panic
  - [x] Rename record to struct
- [ ] Pattern Matching
  - [x] Single-arm match evals to boolean
  - [x] Literals
  - [x] Variables
  - [ ] Optional None
  - [x] Optional Some
  - [ ] Exhaustiveness checking
  - [x] Records
  - [ ] Enums
  - [ ] Multi-case
- [ ] Enums types (enums / tagged unions)
  - [x] Syntax
  - [x] Construction/repr
  - [ ] First, hard cast to variant (`expect`)
  - [ ] Later, pattern match on variants
  - [ ] Built-in .as<Tag> and .is<Tag> functionality!!
- [x] TypedIf allow exprs instead of requiring blocks (did not do; instead improved handling of unit blocks)
- [x] Remove binding 'if' since we have pattern matching
- [x] Abilities
  - [ ] Ability impl decl bugfix (ability impls need to be seen in the decl phase)
- [ ] Ability derivation
  - [ ] I think you have to cache and commit the generated code, or you get the slow proc macros or slow implicit derivation problems that Scala has
- [ ] Figure out the pointer/reference story, maybe use https://github.com/ivmai/bdwgc for GC
- [x] Type Ascriptions
- [ ] Errors (a builtin sum type?)
- [ ] Optional coalescing accessor (x?.y) and ??
- [ ] Pure lambdas with ->
- [ ] Full-on closures with =>
- [ ] Make demo readme

# Old todo list

- [x] Records
  - [x] Syntax decision ({} vs .{} vs Point {})
  - [x] Parsing
  - [x] Typechecking
  - [x] codegen static as LLVM structs
  - [x] Accessor syntax
  - [x] Accessor ir
  - [x] Accessor codegen
- [x] Identifier cleanup and interning
- [x] Actual scoping
- [x] Real prelude so we can more easily add runtime/stl functions (for array)
- [x] Heap memory (just using malloc)
- [x] Arrays (Fixed size but heap allocated)
- [x] Generic functions (no inference)
- [x] Remove / fix TokenIter type
- [x] parens around expressions
- [x] Binary infix operations
- [x] basic error reporting using spans
- [x] Array and Struct member assignment
- [x] While Loop
- [x] Assert (syscall exit? 'panic'?)
- [x] Replace .length on string and array with a MethodCall node (adding empty parens ())
- [x] Change Array repr to a struct w/ length so we have length
- [x] Strings
  - [x] String literals cant have spaces lol
  - [x] print(string)
  - [x] hardcoded via codegen
  - [x] string.length
  - [x] string[i] (int)
  - [x] char
  - [x] string[i] (char)
  - [x] add string.length function
  - [x] char.to_string()
- [x] Concatenate strings (in userland; slow)
- [x] Infer val types
- [x] Extern keyword, then
- [x] Link at build time not via LLVM module
- [x] Use ctx.const_string for printf format strings
- [x] Optionals
- [x] Improve printing output by fixing display functions
- [x] Implement builtin growable array
- [x] Use aggregates in codegen, not pointers, for optionals
- [x] Basic generic type inference in function calls
- [x] Pretty print scopes
- [ ] Precedence of dereference (and i guess unary ops in general) should be higher
- [ ] Change our builtin int type to be 32 bits?
- [ ] Codegen 'variables' is broken (never cleared); use enter scope / exit scope w/ a stack of vecs or something
      instead (matters when a variable id is reused because the same function is called twice; I think we just overwrite it
      with the correct one but maybe nesting is a problem?)
- [x] Support multiple files
- [x] Fix namespaces to require full paths (currently busted must be unique names globally)
- [x] Allow namespaces inside namespaces
- [x] Some debug info in LLVM IR (source snippets or line numbers?)
- [ ] uint type
- [x] Generic type inference
- [ ] Type literals would be fun
- [ ] Syntax Shed
  - [ ] Function syntax change? (foo = fn (a, b, c): int { }
  - [ ] from qualifier-focused to name -focused
  - [ ] Parse trailing commas
- [ ] Tuples

- [-] For iteration (we will just hardcode the iterable types)

  - [x] 'do' version
  - [x] 'yield' version on array
  - [x] 'yield' version on string
  - [x] Provide index var (it_index)

- [x] DEBUG info
  - [x] on or off
  - [x] flag types
  - [x] correct line nums
  - [x] correct spans (depends on multifile)
  - [x] correct file path
  - [ ] Add lexical scopes for if and while

# Optionals

- [x] Optional types
- [x] None types
- [x] None value
- [x] Runtime repr for boolean
- [x] Runtime repr for unit
- [x] Runtime repr for int
- [x] Runtime repr for char
- [x] Runtime repr for string
- [x] struct
- [x] array of optional structs

# Optionals Round 2

- [x] move some-wrapping into a function
- [x] has value from userland (currently only happens by desugaring))
- [x] unwrap from userland (I think this can just be a prelude function not intrinsic)
- [x] test with optional array elements
- [x] test with optional struct fields
- [x] test with optional function args
- [x] Explicit Some() expression

# Dogfood wishlist Oct23

- [x] I really need a way to write code in Zig or C and use it in my stl to move things along
- [x] Zig binding of my Array
- [ ] Early return
- [x] Implicit return of unit if no return statement
- [x] string.indexOf
  - charToString implemented in zig and linked
- [ ] array bounds checking
- [ ] Array.distinct in zig
- [x] Not equal != operator
- [x] Unary negation operator

# Fibonacci todos (Aug 23)

- [x] Equality binop
- [x] Precedence of binops; parens?
- [x] Recursion fix: process module decls first, then impls
- [x] Negative integer literals
- [x] PHI nested branch fix

# Hacks to fix

- [ ] main entrypoint properly. Typing of main? How to get main args?
- [ ] Replace vectors with smallvec where appropriate
- [x] Fix line comments
- [x] Maybe eventually actually free some memory? lol
- [x] Rename IR to typed-ast, since it's a tree not instruction set. TAST?
- [x] Make intrinsics like arrayIndex a real function in the LLVM IR?
- [x] Fix line numbers to account for prelude
- [x] Fix unnecessary load of function args
- [x] Proper println implementation. Fine to use printf internally for now but we should define our own func around it
- [x] Implement Display instead of relying on Debug
