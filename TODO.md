# bfl

Just learning lang dev by implementing a toy language. The goal is to implement all the basics, but maybe
with a few syntactic insights or pet ideas that I like. I am trying not to have any aspirations for this project
except to explore the problem space of compiler development, and maybe to be able to do some of advent of code 2023 in this language

# What? Why?

The project isn't mature enough yet to make this list but the spirit of the effort is this: https://justforfunnoreally.dev/

> The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure thought-stuff. He builds his castles in the air, from air, creating by exertion of the imagination. Few media of creation are so flexible, so easy to polish and rework, so readily capable of realizing grand conceptual structures.... Yet the program construct, unlike the poet's words, is real in the sense that it moves and works, producing visible outputs separate from the construct itself. 

# Up next maybe

- [x] basic error reporting using spans
- [x] Array and Struct member assignment
- [x] While Loop
- [x] Assert (syscall exit? 'panic'?)
- [x] Replace .length on string and array with a MethodCall node (adding empty parens ())
- [x] Change Array repr to a struct w/ length so we have length
- [x] Strings
  - [x] String literals cant have spaces lol
  - [x] print(string)
  - [x] hardcoded via codegen
  - [x] string.length
  - [x] string[i] (int)
  - [x] char
  - [x] string[i] (char)
  - [x] add string.length function
  - [x] char.to_string()
- [x] Concatenate strings (in userland; slow)
- [x] Infer val types
- [x] Extern keyword, then
- [x] Link at build time not via LLVM module
- [x] Use ctx.const_string for printf format strings
- [x] Optionals
- [x] Improve printing output by fixing display functions
- [x] Implement builtin growable array
- [x] Use aggregates in codegen, not pointers, for optionals
- [x] Basic generic type inference in function calls
- [ ] Precedence of dereference (and i guess unary ops in general) should be higher
- [ ] Change our builtin int type to be 32 bits?
- [ ] Make codegen fail instead of panic
- [ ] Codegen 'variables' is broken (never cleared); use enter scope / exit scope w/ a stack of vecs or something instead (matters when a variable id is reused because the same function is called twice; I think we just overwrite it with the correct one but maybe nesting is a problem?)
- [ ] Support multiple files (module ID in all IDs)
- [ ] Builtin maps
- [ ] Fix namespaces to require full paths (currently busted must be unique names globally)
- [ ] Type Ascriptions (literally can just pass expected_type into eval and do an addtl typecheck)
- [ ] For iteration (we will just hardcode the iterable types)
- [ ] Some debug info in LLVM IR (source snippets or line numbers?)
- [ ] Single-arm match syntax with `is`; `if x is Some(y)` instead of `if let Some(y) = x`; if x is not Err(y) (replaces let-else)
- [ ] Sum types (oneofs) (variants?) (tagged unions)
- [ ] Errors
- [ ] uint type
- [ ] Generic type inference
- [ ] Type literals would be fun
- [ ] Syntax Shed
    - [ ] Function syntax change? (foo = fn (a, b, c): int { }
    - [ ] Ditch semicolons? (this technically introduces significant whitespace; need newline token)
    - [ ] from qualifier-focused to name -focused
    - [ ] Parse trailing commas
- [ ] Replace spans on typed ast with just ast node ids
- [ ] Tuples
- [ ] Pure lambdas with ->
- [ ] Full-on closures with =>

- [x] DEBUG info
  - [x] on or off
  - [x] flag types
  - [x] correct line nums
  - [ ] correct spans (depends on multifile)
  - [x] correct file path
  - [ ] Add lexical scopes for if and while
 
# Optionals
- [x] Optional types
- [x] None types
- [x] None value
- [x] Runtime repr for boolean
- [x] Runtime repr for unit
- [x] Runtime repr for int
- [x] Runtime repr for char
- [x] Runtime repr for string
- [x] record
- [x] array of optional records

# Optionals Round 2
- [x] move some-wrapping into a function
- [x] has value from userland (currently only happens by desugaring))
- [x] unwrap from userland (I think this can just be a prelude function not intrinsic)
- [x] test with optional array elements
- [x] test with optional record fields
- [x] test with optional function args
- [x] Explicit Some() expression

# Dogfood wishlist Oct23
- [x] I really need a way to write code in Zig or C and use it in my stl to move things along
- [x] Zig binding of my Array
- [ ] Early return
- [x] Implicit return of unit if no return statement
- [x] string.indexOf
  - charToString implemented in zig and linked
- [ ] array bounds checking
- [ ] Array.distinct in zig
- [x] Not equal != operator
- [x] Unary negation operator

# Fibonacci todos (Aug 20)
- [x] Equality binop
- [x] Precedence of binops; parens?
- [x] Recursion fix: process module decls first, then impls
- [x] Negative integer literals
- [x] PHI nested branch fix

# Hacks to fix
- [x] Fix line comments
- [x] Maybe eventually actually free some memory? lol
- [x] Rename IR to typed-ast, since it's a tree not instruction set. TAST?
- [x] Make intrinsics like arrayIndex a real function in the LLVM IR?
- [x] Fix line numbers to account for prelude
- [ ] main entrypoint properly. Typing of main? How to get main args?
- [ ] Replace vectors with smallvec where appropriate
- [x] Fix unnecessary load of function args
- [x] Proper println implementation. Fine to use printf internally for now but we should define our own func around it
- [x] Implement Display instead of relying on Debug

Design for 
- optionality
- fallibility


# Dev ex
- [ ] Pretty-print AST
- [x] Error Spans
- [x] fancy output COLORS

# Maybe later
- [ ] Block-as-single-arg syntax (xs.map { y => } )
- [x] Type Params
- [ ] Unicode source
- [ ] multiple parameter lists
- [ ] Symbols like lisp or Clojure keywords would be really great; or just have string literal types?
- [ ] Symbols are always interned and very fast. Also signal intent to use a symbol vs use strings

# Resurrect project (March '23)
- [x] Implement typed IR
- [x] Implement FnCall
- [x] Implement Add
- [x] Implement Multiply
